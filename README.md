# Smash It

## About
* **SmashIt** is a tennis playing robot designed to autonomously return incoming tennis balls.
* The robot is a **mobile base with a mounted robotic arm**.
    * **The Base:** The base is a 4 wheel mecanum drive setup.
    * **The Arm:** The arm consist of 2 joints.
      *  Joint 1 is a spherical joint that allows rotation in three degrees of freedom: X, Y, and Z.
      *  The second joint is a simple revolute joint. 
* The project is implemented in both simulation (using Gazebo) and real-world hardware, utilizing ROS2 as the middleware framework.
  
>  [!NOTE]
> This project is divided into 2 parts, Simulation and Real world. The main branch is kept empty for clarity. 
> * Simulation: This part is software based only and uses Gazebo as simulator. Switch to 'simulation' branch to checkout its code.
> * Realworld: This part utilize realworld hardware instead of simulation. Switch to 'real_world' branch to checkout its code.

## Real World(Work in Progress)
A real world model os "SmashIt" is also being worked upon. As of now, the base(4 wheel cart) is completed and is fully functional. It can navigate to a specified coordinate within a given time, provided the input is feasible. However, due to the absence of external references like GPS, vision, or LiDAR, positional drift occurs over time. Later, an IR-based stereo vision setup will be added as an external reference. The follwoing are the key highlits of the base cart: 

* The base cart uses an Raspberry Pi Pico(for onboard computation) and an NodeMCU ESP-8226(for wireless communication).
* Heavy computations are done on a desktop computer and is sent to Raspberry Pi Pico via ESP-8226.
* 4x **775 DC motors** are used.
* 4x custom gearbox have been created to increase the torque of the 775 DC motors. Gearbox images and specification are available below.
* 4x **Double BTS7960 high current motor drivers** are used.
* An **MPU-6050(IMU)** is also installed which provides accelerometer and gyroscope data.
* A 12v battery with a buck converter is used to power the Pico and ESP.

### Data Flow
 The following steps explain how data flows throughout the system:
 * **PC Side:** Initial position(0,0) of the robot is compared with goal position and the resulting distance is fed into an mecanum drive controller. The controller generates individual velocity(using Inverse Kinematics) reguired by each wheel to reach goal which are forwarded to the ESP-8266 via WiFi
 * **ESP Side:** It simply forwards the data to Pico via UART.
 * **Pico Side:** On the pico there are 2 cores with the following responsiblities:
    * **Core 0:**
       * Receiving wheel velocities from ESP and forwarding it to motor controller.
       * Generating  interrupt requesting data from Core 1.
       * Estimating robot position using Encoder and IMU readings.
       * Forwarding th estimated robot position to ESP.
    * **Core 1:**
       * Collecting data from 4 encoders and an IMU.
       * Sending  data to core 0 as soon as an interrupt is generated. Core 1 is kept reserved for sensor data collection.
         
 * Once the robot position is estimated, the pico sends data to ESP which inturn forwards it to the PC and the process repeats.
 
### Gear Box
A custom gearbox is created to increase the torque of the 775 DC motor. The details are as follows:
* 775 Base motor torque: 0.116 NÂ·m
* Gearbox Ratio: 6:1
* Total torque output per wheel(motor + gearbox): 0.696 N.m
